# Progress log

Newest entry at the bottom. Each session adds 3–5 lines: what shipped, decisions
made, open issues. Keep entries short; this file is read at the start of every session.

## Decisions so far
- Stack: Next.js + TypeScript, Tailwind + shadcn/ui, Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage), Vercel.
- Storage starts in Supabase Storage; move images to Cloudflare R2 if download costs grow.
- The directory links out only. The 21 sites' homepages are the only images captured from them.
- Prototype of the directory: single-page artifact "Ref Index" (October 2026).

## Log
### Session 0 · Scaffold (2026-10-27)
- Next.js 16.4 (App Router, Turbopack) + React 19 + TS strict, Tailwind 4, ESLint flat config,
  `typecheck` script. Fonts: Bricolage Grotesque (display), IBM Plex Sans/Mono via next/font.
- shadcn configured by hand (components.json, tokens in globals.css carrying the prototype's
  green palette, `cn` util); next-themes light/dark/system with a toggle.
- Supabase helpers in src/lib/supabase (browser + server, publishable key). Supabase CLI is a
  dev dependency; hosted project only. Session-refresh proxy deferred to Session 2.
- shadcn components added from shadcn's GitHub source (new-york-v4): button, input, dialog,
  dropdown-menu, sheet, sonner, command, toggle-group, toggle, badge, skeleton. Deps: radix-ui,
  cmdk, sonner. ThemeToggle now uses Button (44px target). Add more later with
  `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <name>` on a machine with normal network access.
- Deployed: https://ref-index.vercel.app (Vercel Hobby, functions in sin1 via vercel.json;
  every push to main deploys). Supabase project ref `kolzsxfgqodulzteocnd` (Singapore).
  Auth Site URL = production URL; redirect allow list = production/** and localhost:3000/**.
- Vercel env vars set (NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY;
  Config type, all environments) and production redeployed. Nothing reads them until
  Session 2, which is the first real check that they're correct.
- Commits must use the GitHub-linked email (96169814+hystericmoon@users.noreply.github.com)
  or Vercel blocks the deploy.

### Session 1 · Database schema and seed (2026-10-28)
- 5 migrations pushed to the hosted project: tables + FKs + indexes (pg_trgm on tag labels and
  app names), `screens.search_vector` kept current by triggers (app name A, tag labels B,
  synonyms C, notes D; config `english`), RLS, taxonomy seed (5 facets, 49 tags with synonyms),
  21 sources from docs/sources.json. Advisors: no issues.
- Decisions: `apps` has an `owner_id` (apps are private like screens). Reference data is seeded
  in migrations, not seed.sql. Facets/tags/sources are read-only via the API. Trigger functions
  live in a `private` schema the Data API doesn't expose.
- RLS test `supabase/tests/rls_screens.sql` (one transaction, rolled back) passes: B can't read,
  edit, delete or tag A's rows; anon can't query screens. Run with
  `.\node_modules\.bin\supabase db query --linked -f supabase/tests/rls_screens.sql`.
- Types in src/lib/db/types.ts (`supabase gen types typescript --linked --schema public`), typed
  helpers per table in src/lib/db, Supabase clients typed with `Database`.
- `listScreens({ tagIds })` matches any tag (two queries); Session 6 should replace it with an RPC
  for all-tags filtering plus search.

## Later
_(ideas and out-of-scope items noted during sessions)_
- `pnpm <script>` currently fails a lockfile check (minimumReleaseAge rejects lucide-react 1.62.0
  and electron-to-chromium 1.5.465). Should clear once they age past the cutoff; until then call
  bins directly (`.\node_modules\.bin\supabase`, `tsc`, `eslint`, `next build`).
- pnpm ignores the `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` field in package.json; move it to
  pnpm-workspace.yaml (`onlyBuiltDependencies`).
- The Supabase project is in ap-northeast-1 (Tokyo), not Singapore as noted in Session 0, while
  Vercel functions run in sin1. Either move the functions region to hnd1 or accept the latency.
